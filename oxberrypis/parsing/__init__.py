Parsing of the NYSE Arca Feed data.

NYSE supplies 4 different channel feeds (http://www.nyxdata.com/page/1084):

  The NYSE Arca Integrated Feed now lists four channels each A-Z. What
  is significant about four channels?

  The four channels will send data via matching engine ID's, which are
  load balanced across all letter ranges A-Z. Four-channel delivery of
  this feed will benefit customers by reducing the overall delivery
  latency with this product. These channel configurations will help our
  publishers achieve the very lowest latency possible.
