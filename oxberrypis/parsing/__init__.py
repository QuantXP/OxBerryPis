Parsing of the NYSE Arca Feed data.


| The NYSE Arca Integrated Feed now lists four channels each A-Z. What
| is significant about four channels?
|
| The four channels will send data via matching engine ID's, which are
| load balanced across all letter ranges A-Z. Four-channel delivery of
| this feed will benefit customers by reducing the overall delivery
| latency with this product. These channel configurations will help our
| publishers achieve the very lowest latency possible.
